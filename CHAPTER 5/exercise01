Exercise 1: Write a program which repeatedly reads integers until the user enters
“done”. Once “done” is entered, print out the total, count, and average of the
integers. If the user enters anything other than a integers, detect their mistake
using try and except and print an error message and skip to the next integers.
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: bad data
Invalid input
Enter a number: 7
Enter a number: done
16 3 5.333333333333333


# Repeatedly reads integer until type 'done' and then print total, count, average of the integers
count = 0
total = 0.0
while True:
    inp = input("Enter a number: ")
    if inp == 'done':
        break
    try:
        finp = float(inp)
        #print(finp)
        count += 1
        total = total + finp
    except:
        print("Invalid input")
    
print(total, count, total/count)
