Exercise 3: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?


answer - An interpreter translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code line-by-line as the code runs. A compiler translates code from a high-level programming language (like Python, JavaScript or Go) into machine code before the program runs.
