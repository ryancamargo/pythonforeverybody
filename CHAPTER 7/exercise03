Exercise 3:
Sometimes when programmers get bored or want to have a bit of fun, they add a
harmless Easter Egg to their program. Modify the program that prompts the user
for the file name so that it prints a funny message when the user types in the exact
file name “na na boo boo”. The program should behave normally for all other files
which exist and don’t exist. Here is a sample execution of the program:
python egg.py
Enter the file name: mbox.txt
There were 1797 subject lines in mbox.txt
python egg.py
Enter the file name: missing.tyxt
File cannot be opened: missing.tyxt
python egg.py
Enter the file name: na na boo boo
NA NA BOO BOO TO YOU - You have been punk'd!
We are not encouraging you to put Easter Eggs in your programs; this is just an
exercise.


# Look for lines that start with x-DSPAM ... get the all the numbers, print the average
name = input('Enter a file name: ')
try:
    fhand = open(name)
except:
    if name == 'na na boo boo':
        print('NA NA BOO BOO TO YOU - You have been punk'd!')
    print('File can not be opened: ', name)
    quit()

list = []
str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:'
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith(str):
        space = line.find(' ')
        number = float(line[space + 1:])
        list.append(number)

print('Average spam confidence: ', (sum(list) / len(list)))
