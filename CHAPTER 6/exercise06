Exercise 6: String methods
Read the documentation of the string methods at
https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods.
You might want to experiment with some of them to make sure you understand
how they work. strip and replace are particularly useful.
The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing. For example, in
find(sub[, start[, end]]), the brackets indicate optional arguments. So sub
is required, but start is optional, and if you include start, then end is optional.

# Using strip() and replace()
name = input('First and last name: ')
# Print the first and last name replacing a for i
print(name.replace('a', 'i'))

# Getting rid of spaces
print(name.strip().replace('a', 'i')) ###############
