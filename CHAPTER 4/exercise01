Exercise 1: Run the program on your system and see what numbers you get. Run
the program more than once and see what numbers you get.
The random function is only one of many functions that handle random numbers.
The function randint takes the parameters low and high, and returns an integer
between low and high (including both).
>>> random.randint(5, 10)
5
>>> random.randint(5, 10)

To choose an element from a sequence at random, you can use choice:
>>> t = [1, 2, 3]
>>> random.choice(t)
2
>>> random.choice(t)

The random module also provides functions to generate random values from continuous distributions including Gaussian, exponential, gamma, and a few more.
